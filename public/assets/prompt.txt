Using this, define 15 question to find a character, a battle type and a romance you're closest to. The question must be like the one you asked me : Inspired by real life situation. They must be single choice question. For each question, tell me what's measured.
You must discriminate between:
Shepard, Liara, Jack, Grunt, Kasumi, Jacob, Miranda, Garrus, Thane, Wrex, Legion, Kaidan, Ashley, James, Traynor, Cortez, Gabriella Daniels, Kenneth Donnely, Joker, Mordin, EDI, Samara, Zaeed, Tali, Javik, David Anderson, Cortez, Chakwas, Hackett, , the Illusive man, Udina, Aria TLoak

---

Give me the answers that should be given to get Liara, and Jack personalities for each question.
Give which answer should be given to get them as a romance result (ie. which answers would pair wells with their personality).
Note that they should not be paired with themselves for romance. For example, jack is matched with paragon shepard : someone understanding and who can defuse the situation, Garrus is matched with a Tali type personality, paragon shepard is matched with Liara, Kenneth with Gabriella, Wrex with Eve Urdnot, Kasumi with Jacob, Joker with EDI, Anderson with Kahlee Sanders, Samara with Paragon shepard, the illusive man with himself, Grunt with someone like him,fun, Traynor with EDI, etc...

Give your result in this form:

# paragon shepard

A description of their personality in a few line, and their MBTI
